# Django RESTful API Blog Project (Current Project)

(Updated March 1st, 2020) Currently building a Django blog application using the Django Rest Framework. Building out database using SQLite3 to store blog user, post and category data. 

The API I am building is going to be consumed by a front-end react app to display the blog entries, and will eventually have user authenticaion.
